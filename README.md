An Arduino board to allow my homebrew computer
[dastaZ80](https://github.com/dasta400/dzOS) to communicate with different
devices like Real-Time Clock, NVRAM, SD card, Floppy Disc Drive, and more.

Technically it is possible (but not tested) to use this project with any other
kind of computer or microcontroller that has a serial communication port.

---

## Why this project?

As I wanted to add some more peripherals (a Real-Time Clock (RTC), an SD
card, an NVRAM and a Floppy Disc Drive) to my homebrew computer
[dastaZ80](https://github.com/dasta400/dzOS), I made some calculations of the cost.
Between components and PCBs, I came up with the  total cost of around â‚¬210.
As I've already spent a couple of hundreds so far, this hobby is starting to be
too expensive for my pocket.

On the other hand, I have already several Arduino boards (Uno, Mega2560,
Leonardo) and several devices I got on a developer's kit, which happened to
contain a DS3231 RTC (with NVRAM included) and a MicroSD Card Adapter.

So I thought, why not make an Arduino to communicate with those peripherals, and then make the Arduino to communicate with the dastaZ80. Just like if it was an external controller?

As all Arduinos include serial ports (TX / RX pins) and I have a spare serial port
on the dastaZ80 (SIO/2 Channel B), it should be relatively easy to make them to
talk to each other.

## This branch

Initially I had the ASMDC as controller for FDD, RTC and SD card, but I was
adding code I stumbled with Arduino errors because apparently I was using more
memory than the available. Hence, I decided to separate the code in branches.

This branch contains ONLY the code necessary for the SD card controller.

---

## How it works?

The dastaZ80's SIO/2 Channel B is connected to an Arduino Mega2560's serial port.
The dastaZ80 sends [commands](#commands) (identified by a unique single byte) to the Arduino, which interprets the received command and communicates with the corresponding attached device (e.g. get time from the RTC), and sends information back to the dastaZ80.

## Advantages/Disadvantages

* **Advantages**:
  * Cost next to zero, as I already have all the necessary hardware.
  * The SD card is formatted with FAT16, so it's readable by modern PCs.
  * The SD card holds disk images, which makes easy to swap between different
  images, or to have multiple disks.
  * Expandable. For example to add a PseudoRandom Number Generator (PRNG).
* **Disadvanges**:
  * Slower disk (SD card) access? I didn't benchmark it yet.

## Commands

The Arduino responds to commands received that are identified by an unique
single byte:

### A0 (FDD status)

Tells the status of the FDD.

This command should be called after each command on the FDD to check if the
command was successful or not. Any value other than 0x00 indicates and error.

* **Lower Nibble** (0x00 if all OK)
  * **bit 0** = not used
  * **bit 1** = not used
  * **bit 2** = set if last command resulted in error
  * **bit 3** = not used
* **Upper Nibble** (error code)

### B0 (SD Card status)

Tells the status of the SD Card reader.

This command should be called after each command on the SD card to check if the
command was successful or not. Any value other than 0x00 indicates and error.

* **Lower Nibble** (0x00 if all OK)
  * **bit 0** = set if SD card was not found
  * **bit 1** = set if image file was not found
  * **bit 2** = set if last command resulted in error
  * **bit 3** = not used
* **Upper Nibble** (number of disk image files found)

### C0 (Get RTC info)

Tells information of the configuration of the RTC module.

Useful, for example if the time is not kept accurately, to check if the clock is
running or not.

* **Byte 1**
  * **bit 0** = set if clock is running.
  * **bit 1** = set if clock is in 24 hours mode. Otherwise, clock is in 12 hours mode
  * **bit 2** = set if alarm 1 is ON
  * **bit 3** = set if alarm 2 is ON

## Tools

These tools are for use with [dzOS](https://github.com/dasta400/dzOS). Otherwise,
don't have much of a purpose.

And are written with [FreeBASIC](https://www.freebasic.net/). To compile use _fbc -static \<program>.bas_

### imgmnr (Image Manager)

Allows to add, extract, rename, delete and change attributes of files inside a DZFS image file. Plus create new image file, display the image file's catalogue and display the Superblock information.

* Parameters:
  * **-new** \<file> \<label> = create a new image
  * **-sblock**             = show Superblock
  * **-cat**                = show disk Catalogue
  * **-add** \<file>         = add file to image
  * **-get** \<file>         = extract file from image
  * **-del** \<file>         = mark file as deleted
  * **-ren** \<old> \<new>    = rename old filename to new
  * **-attr** \<file> \<RHSE> = set new attributes to file

### makeimgfile (Make Image File)

Creates a Disk Image File and adds files from a list.

In essence, allows me to re-assemble my programs and create a Disk Image File
directly on the SD Card.

* Parameters:
  * \<filelist> = list of files to include in Image File
    * Create an ASCII text file, and in each line add the name (with path relative to directory where this tool is running) of a binary file to be added to the Image File.
  * \<imgfile>  = Image File (name) to be created
  * \<label>    = Volume Label
  * \<imgsize>  = Image File size in MB (max. 33)
